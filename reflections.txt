How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?


How often to commit?
-- A good rule of thumb is to make one commit per local change.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: Greater level of control and flexibility.
Cons: Chances of missing the commit when it should have been done.



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
